### Weapon Types Over Time
The dynamic bar chart illustrating how the usage of different weapon types varies over time. Year 1993 is filtered out, because it has no data.

- Dynamic Interaction: The chart is interactive. You can hover over the bars to see the exact count and weapon type for a specific year.
- Time Slider: A slider allows you to adjust the year, enabling you to observe changes in weapon type usage across different years.

A notable trend observed throughout the years is the prevalence of Explosives, which consistently shows a high number of incidents, making it the most frequently used weapon type. Firearms typically follow as the second most common, while Incendiary weapons and, to a lesser extent, Melee weapons also appear with some regularity. Other weapon types such as Chemical, Sabotage Equipment, Fake Weapons, Radiological, Biological, and Other tend to be used much less frequently across the time period represented in the data.

### Top Perpetrator Groups Over Time

This graph illustrates how the number of attacks attributed to the top 10 perpetrator groups has changed across different years. Unknown group is skipped to increase clarity.

- Dynamic Interaction: The graph is interactive. You can hover over the lines to see the exact number of attacks and the corresponding year for each group.
- Trend Visualization: The lines represent the trend for each perpetrator group over the years, allowing you to observe how their activity increases or decreases.
- Comparative Analysis: By plotting multiple groups on the same graph, it enables a comparison of their activity levels and trends.

The graph shows how the activity of different perpetrator groups has evolved over time. For example, you can observe the rise and fall of attacks by groups like the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) over the decades. Additionally, the graph highlights the emergence and surge in activity of groups like ISIL in more recent years. The Taliban, however, shows a noticeable presence throughout the entire period with varying levels of activity.
